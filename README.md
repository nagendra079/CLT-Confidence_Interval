# CLT-Confidence_Interval
Central Limit Theorem.
Calculation of confidence intervals using Python.
Central Limit Theorem applies when sample size is large. Only then the distribution of means possess a normal distribution.
When sample size is small we use t-distribution.Since t-distribution has more values towards its tail unlike normal distribution, t-distribution interval size is larger than normal distribution interval size.
